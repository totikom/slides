# Presentation slides monorepo

In this repository I store presentations for my talks.

Each directory is a separate presentation, that can be build by [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) via `make`:
```bash
# build
make compile
# or just
make

# watch
make watch

# delete build artifacts
make clean
```
